# Materials about Covid-19
In this repository I collect some of the materials I produced during the Covid-19 crisis.
Most of them are in Italian.

At the moment the relevant files are:
- rapporto_italia_short.html : short presentation of the state space method I used to estimate the level and rate of various Covid-19 related time series.
- app.R : the R Shiny app wrote to track level and rate for the Covid time series. The app runs here: [https://matteopelagatti.shinyapps.io/Covid19_report/](https://matteopelagatti.shinyapps.io/Covid19_report/).
- ColorZones.csv : the daily time series of the color assigned to each Italian region according to its risk. Dates in rows and regions in columns, wih first column containing dates (yyyy-mm-dd).
